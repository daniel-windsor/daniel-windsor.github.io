                    <h1>Relative, Absolute and Fixed Positioning</h1>
                    <h2>A discussion</h2>
                    <p>Every element on a webpage is a box. It may not look like it (it might look like a circle) but
                        the element
                        itself is contained inside a box. This box can be moved to different positions on the page with
                        CSS. There
                        are many
                        types of positions in css. The main ones are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>position: relative</li>
                        <li>position: absolute</li>
                        <li>position: fixed</li>
                    </ul>



                    <!-- position: relative -->
                    <p><strong>position: relative</strong> allows you to move the box <em>relative</em> to where it
                        would
                        appear in
                        the normal flow of the document. Say you've got a header and an image in your html. Following
                        the normal
                        flow of the document, on your webpage the header would appear on top, and the image just below.
                        If you set
                        the position of the image to relative, you could then shift it from it's normal position by
                        using the
                        attributes top, bottom, left, and right to move the picture down, up, right, and left
                        respectively.</p>

                    <div class="container has-text-centered">
                        <h3>Look at this cat. Do it now.</h3>
                    </div>

                    <div class="columns">

                        </div>
                        <div class="column">
                            <pre><code>
                                    #relative-cat {
                                        position: relative;
                                        right: 200px;
                                    }
                                </code></pre>
                            <p>This cat was moved 200px to the left, relative to his normal position in the center of
                                the box</p>
                        </div>

                    </div>
                    <!-- /position: relative -->

                    <!-- position: absolute -->
                    <p><strong>position: absolute</strong> allows you to define the exact position of the element. You
                        can also use
                        the attributes top, bottom, left, and right to set the position. These values will be relative
                        to the parent
                        of that element. Keep in mind that position: absolute removes the object from the normal flow of
                        the
                        document.</p>

                                    position: absolute;
                                    right: 200px;
                                }
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>This cat has the same parameters as the previous cat, except he has been moved 200px to
                                the left relative to the <em>parent</em> i.e. 200px from the right of the box</p>
                        </div>


                    </div>
                    <!-- /position: absolute -->

                    <!-- position: fixed -->
                    <p><strong>position: fixed</strong> is similar to position: absolute in that you can define exactly
                        where the
                        element is placed. The difference though is that instead of the position being relative to the
                        parent
                        object, it's relative to the <i>viewport.</i> This means as the user scrolls, the element moves
                        with them as
                        if it was stuck to the screen.</p>
