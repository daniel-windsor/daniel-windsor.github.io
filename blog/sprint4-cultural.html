            <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <p>
              Neuroplasticity is the idea that your brain is not a fixed, rigid
              structure. It changes and flexes and grows as you use it and learn
              more. This understanding can greatly benefit people, as by
              understanding this concept you can start to take advantage of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The old idea of 'you have what you are born with' is outdated and
              detrimental. It discourages striving to better oneself. By
              understanding that you can improve and become smarter, it removes
              those mental barriers and allows for hope and aspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep learning. I play music as a semi-professional hobby. All
              music teachers encourage regular practice, as playing an
              instrument is definitely a 'use it or lose it' type deal. If you
              skip a day of practice, you know about it. If you
              skip two days of practice, everyone knows about it.
              Neuroplasticity is the same way. If you don't use your brain, if
              you don't keep learning and forming those connections, you'll lose
              your neuroplasticity. There are other methods to help increase
              neuroplasticity as well - things like mindfulness, meditation,
              getting rest. As an added bonus, these activities are good for
              your general health and wellbeing too!
            </p>
            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p>Having a 'growth mindset' is the idea that you believe in your
              potential. As we know from our understanding of neuroplasticity,
              you have the ability to change, grow and learn new things. Having
              this mindset can be a huge benefit when approaching a difficult
              challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say a person attempts to solve a difficult puzzle. They do
              not have a growth mindset. They believe their abilities to be
              fixed, that there are certain things they just can't do or will
              never understand, and that attempting to do so is a waste of time.
              The second that person starts to struggle with something, chances
              are they will shut down. They will back away from the challenge
              because they <em>know</em> they can't do it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously this particular approach is not a very
              effective one, and there is no room for personal
              growth
            </p>
            <p>Say this same person approaches the same problem, but this time instead of having a fixed mindset they have a growth mindset.  When they encounter trouble, instead of shutting down, they get interested.  They try harder.  Maybe they solve the problem, maybe not, but they learn something in the process.  They are better off having given it a go.  This is a growth mindset.</p>
            <h2>How does this influence my learning?</h2>
            <p>
              Being aware of these two concepts will certainly help in my learning.  I understand that the brain is not a rigid structure and that it can change.  Because of this I know I don't have to be good at or understand everything.  With practice my brain will change and eventually I will understand.  I can apply the growth mindset.  "I don't get it now, but with practice and effort eventually I will".  Nothing ever comes easy in life.  To get the best rewards, you've got to try your best.
