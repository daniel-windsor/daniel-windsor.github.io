            <h1>Getting into JavaScript</h1>
            <p>
              The focus for this week has been JavaScript. We've gone through a
              whole lot of content on FreeCodeCamp to get the basics. Here is a
              summary of some things I've learned.
            </p>

            <h3>HTML and CSS: What's the difference?</h3>

              <div class="column">
                <span class="has-text-centered">
                  <h4>CSS</h4>
                </span>
                <pre><code>

            </div>
            <p>
              HTML and CSS are two different (but important) parts of a website.
              The HTML is the structure. The foundation. It's made up of
              building blocks that together make the bones of your website. In
              the above example you can see a lot of what are called
              <strong>HTML Tags</strong> i.e. &lt;body>, &lt;section>, &lt;div>,
              and &lt;p> to name just a few. These tags provide the structure to
              the web page.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS is what makes that structure pretty. It gives it colour, shape
              and personality. In the above example we are setting a background
              image, moving an element around the page and giving another a
              margin between it and other elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              These examples are real life code that were used in creating this
              site.
            </p>

            <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
            <p>Here are some examples of statements and loops</p>
            <div class="columns">
              <div class="column">
                <span class="has-text-centered">
                  <h4>If/Else Statement</h4>
                </span>
                <pre><code>
if(ice-cream == 'delicious') {
    console.log('Ice cream is delicious')
}  else {
    console.log('Error, Ice cream is delicious')
}



                            </code></pre>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <span class="has-text-centered">
                  <h4>Switch Statement</h4>
                </span>
                <pre><code>
switch (ice-cream) {
    case 'chocolate':
        eatIceCream()
        break;
    case 'raisin':
        binIceCream()
        break;
}
                            </code></pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="columns">
              <div class="column">
                <span class="has-text-centered">
                  <h4>For Loop</h4>
                </span>
                <pre><code>
for (let i = 0; i < iceCream.length; i++) {
    iceCreamInTum += 1
}


                            </code></pre>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <span class="has-text-centered">
                  <h4>Do While Loop</h4>
                </span>
                <pre><code>
let i = 0
do {
    eatIceCream()
    i++
} while (i < iceCream.length)
                            </code></pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              To control the flow of the code is to direct it in a particular
              directions using different checks. By using an if/else statement
              or a switch statement, you can check to see if certain conditions
              are true, and execute different code blocks based on the result.
              In the switch statement above for example, we are checking the
              flavour of the ice cream and executing an action based on the
              result - eating the ice cream if it is chocolate, and throwing it
              out if it is raisin. Raisins should be illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Loops are used to repeat a block of code <em>until</em> a
              condition becomes true. In the above Do While Loop, we eat ice
              cream then continue to do so until there is no ice cream left.
            </p>

            <h3>The DOM</h3>
            <p>
              The DOM, or <solid>Document Object Model</solid> is a
              representation of all the objects that come together to form a
              webpage. It takes the form of a tree-like structure, starting with
              the <code>window</code> at the top (through which the user views
              the site e.g. firefox), then down to the
              <code>document</code> (the site itself). From that is all the
              other elements like <code>images</code> and <code>forms</code> and
              <code>anchors</code> and the list goes on and on and on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything you see (and don't see) on a website will be
              represented <em>somewhere</em> in the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              The beauty of this is you can use JavaScript (and other languages)
              to access the dom and programmatically change it. You could get a
              reference to a header and change it's colour. You could change the
              dimensions of an image. You could even use it to insert totally
              new elements, or make existing ones disappear. It's a very
              powerful tool. Use it wisely.
            </p>

            <h3>Arrays and Objects - Accessing Data</h3>
            <p>Here is an example of an array and an object</p>
            <div class="columns">
              <div class="column">
                <span class="has-text-centered"><h4>Array</h4></span>
                <pre><code>
iceCream['Chocolate', 'Vanilla', 'Feijoa', 'Orange Choc-chip']




                            </code></pre>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <span class="has-text-centered"><h4>Object</h4></span>
                <pre><code>
iceCream = {
    flavour: 'chocolate',
    temperature: '6',
    cone: true
}
                            </code></pre>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              An array is essentially a list. We have a list of ice cream
              flavours contained in the variable 'ice cream'. Each item in that
              list has an index assigned to it, starting at 0 for the item in
              the first position. To access a particular item in that list we
              can use its index. For example to access feijoa, we would use
              iceCream[2]. Note the use of square brackets here. There are
              various other methods that can be used on an array, such as
              iceCream.length which would return the number of items on the
              list, and iceCream.push('Mint'), which would add Mint to the list.
            </p>
            <p>
              An object is similar to an array in that it is like a list, but
              instead of being a list of items, it is a list of key value pairs
              relating to a singular item. In the example we have the object
              iceCream. It has several key parameters, these being flavour,
              temperature, and whether or not it comes in a cone. Each of these
              keys has a value assigned to it. To access the values we can use
              dot notation. For instance, iceCream.temperature will return 6.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further complicate things, it is possible to have an array of
              objects, or to have an array within your object, or both! Then you
              need to use a combination of dot notation and square bracket
              notation to access the correct field.
            </p>

            <h3>What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
            <div class="columns">
              <div class="column">
                <p>
                  'Function' is another word for a method. It is a set of
                  instructions to complete a specific task. A class consists of
                  many different functions working together. A function could
                  look like this example on the right. First we have the
                  function declaration and the name of the function (function
                  buyIceCream) which takes a parameter called money. The
                  function then performs a check - if the value of money is
                  greater than 4.5, it returns iceCream. If not, it returns
                  sadness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Functions are useful because we can reuse them as much as we
                  like. These steps might need to be used multiple times through
                  our code, and by calling a function, it means we don't have to
                  write the same code out each time.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <pre><code>
function buyIceCream(money) {
    if(money > 4.5) {
        return iceCream
    } else {
        return sadness
    }
}
                            </code></pre>
