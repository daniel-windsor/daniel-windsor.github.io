            <h1>Foundation's Core Skills</h1>
            <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and
              your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
              I like to think I don't have an ego. Doesn't everyone? This isn't
              entirely true though. One thing I've learned is that if I'm not
              careful, a little bit of an ego can start to grow. I need to be
              aware of this and squash it back down. An ego isn't helpful to
              anyone so I try hard not to listen to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned the names of my values.  As I'll discuss below this was challenging but super beneficial.  By know the names I can more accurately recognise what they are and how they should affect my life.
            </p>
            <p>I also learned to pay more attention to how I'm feeling.  Previously if I was working on something and started feeling a little off, I would kind of ignore it and push through.  By going through this core process I've learned it's not necessarily the healthiest option for your mental wellbeing.  Now while coding I've tried to stay aware of what my body is telling me, and respond appropriately.  Self care is important.</p>
            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in
              learning and programming?</h2>
            <p>
              In the learning and coding environment there is a lot of team
              work.
              Having empathy will allow you to put yourself in other people's
              shoes and get a sense of how they might be doing. In this intense
              environment it's important to look out for one another and make
              sure
              everyone is doing ok. Having empathy will allow you to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being self aware will allow you to reflect on your words or
              actions,
              and the effect they may have on others. It's also important for
              self
              care. As we must look out for each other, we must also look after
              ourselves. It's important to take stock of how you're feeling,
              make
              sure you're getting enough rest and aren't burning out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Values are that moral compass. There are some
              challenging times
              ahead, but if you stick to your values you should be
              able to
              navigate through without too much stress or distress.
            </p>

            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
              How challenging it was. Initially I didn't think it would be too
              bad. Have a sit and a think and there you go. Turns out being
              introspective is a bit more involved than that.
            </p>

            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The first values and strengths section. Values for a me are more
              of a feeling thing. There's that little niggle in your brain when
              your values are being challenged. I've known I have values, but
              actually putting a name to what they are was really hard.
            </p>

            <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so
              much time focusing on core learning in a web development
              bootcamp course?</h2>
            <p>
              We're working on the full package. To be a good developer knowing
              how to code well isn't enough. You need to be able to work with
              people, as a team. The core skills will help with that.
            </p>

            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel
              like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
              practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
            <p>
              No, for the above reason. Developing these core skills will be
              super useful. I had to work harder at the core exercises than I
              did with some of the coding ones!
