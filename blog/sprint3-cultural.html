                    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
                    <h2>EQ vs IQ</h2>
                    <p>People often think that your IQ, your cognitive intelligence, plays a major role in determining how far a person goes in life.  The idea being the smarter a person is, the further they'll go, the higher up the ladder they will be able to climb.  This may not necessarily be the case.  It is now thought that your EQ, your emotional intelligence plays just as large a role.</p>
                    <p>EQ stands for emotional quotient.  It is a measure of a person's level of emotional intelligence.  This refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions. Having a good EQ can play a major role in how effective you are in your work environment, and the higher up the ladder you go, the more important EQ becomes.</p>
                    <p>Think about the last manager you had, and your relationship with them.  How did you feel about them as a person?  Were you able to relate to them, or talk with them easily?  Having good EQ is the difference between a manager being effective, and being... less than ideal.  Someone with good EQ is able to empathise with their employees, identify their emotions and control their own.  They are able to use these emotions to facilitate conversation.  These are the characteristics of a good boss.</p>
                    <p>If EQ is something you've never considered before, or an area in which you find yourself lacking, don't worry!  There are ways to develop your own EQ.  In an effort to develop emotional intelligence a particular exercise we tried was conscious listening.</p>
                    <h2>Conscious Listening</h2>
                    <p>Conscious listening is exactly as it sounds.  You listen... consciously.  Sit down with another person.  Let them talk.  Don't interrupt, don't spend the whole time thinking about what you want to say.  Just listen.  Be aware of what they are saying.  Be mindful.  Let them talk for a few minutes.  The next step is to loop back to them.  Use sentences like, "What I heard you say is..." Feed back what you heard.  They might choose to add little bits in or clarify what they meant.  Continue looping until you reach an agreement.</p>
