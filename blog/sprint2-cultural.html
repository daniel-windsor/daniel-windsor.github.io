          <h1>Learning Reflections</h1>
          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>At this point I'm still not 100% sure, as I'm not super up to speed with what opportunities are available.
            I envisage myself getting a job in a small to midsize company. I've done the 'work with heaps of employees
            where no one knows any one' and it gets old pretty quick. I want a place with a good environment. Also I
            think it's important to be working on something I'm interested in. A project I can really get invested in.
            Also staying local is important. I like Wellington. It's cool here.</p>
          <h3>What skills (non-technical human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
          <p>Networking. The non-technical kind. I find it super hard to approach people and introduce myself out of no
            where. I'm much more likely to sit quietly in a corner and try not to make too much eye contact. Terrible.
            Once I have an in then it's fine, but that first step is just so hard.</p>
          <h3>Describe your own strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>Team work! I've had a lot a practice in working as part of a team. My previous role was running a team so I
            got pretty good at the skills involved with this. Things like keeping the communication open between
            different members. Delegating tasks. Keeping people to due dates. A key one taking a lot of information
            being provided by a lot of people and use it to come to a decision. Some times it was a discussion and a
            group decision, sometimes it was 'this is how it needs to be'. Sometimes you just need someone to make a
            call, and lucky for me that was my job. Hopefully these skills will be of use through this process</p>
          <p>The one part of team leading that I still struggle with is the conflict management. It's hard dealing with
            angry people. No one likes it.</p>
          <p>The other thing I have struggled with is motivation. In the past there have been times (some times a lot of
            times) where I need to work on something, but there's also something more fun I could do instead. Not the
            best. So far though, because web dev is the something more fun, it hasn't been a problem. I'll aim to keep
            it that way!</p>
          <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
            should
            include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
            learners,
            facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
          <p>First step is to pace myself and to know my own limitations. It's not super healthy to do eight or ten
            hours of work straight, so I'll make sure to give myself regular mini breaks. Quick stretch then let's keep
            going. Also stay hydrated and eat well.</p>
          <p>Another key that I've touched on before is that good communication. Be open with others about how you're
            feeling. If things aren't going well, or if you're feeling overwhelmed let people know. Discuss with your
            cohort, with the staff. Get support if needed.</p>
          <p>Then you've got the basics. Be kind. Be respectful. We're all in this together.</p>
          <p>This is my commitment.</p>
          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>There are so many people available to offer support. The other members of my cohort. EDA staff. I have some
            programming friends. The internet. If ever I am super stuck help is not that far away. If someone is busy,
            find someone else! I think I have enough understanding to know the difference between 'I am struggling
            because this is a tricky task' and 'I'm struggling because I'm totally lost'. In the case of the latter,
            I'll ask for help. No point in mucking around.</p>
          <p>I commit to this also.</p>
          <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>Support. A nudge in the right direction. I don't expect (or want) them to just hand out the answers all the
            time. You don't learn that way. I want to be guided to find the answers for myself. Key word - facilitator,
            not teacher.</p>
          <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example,
            you
            might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h3>
          <p>None. I have basically shut everything down for the time at boot camp. No other commitments. I do have a
            family so I perhaps won't be able to stay as late as others all the time, but aside from that let's go!</p>
