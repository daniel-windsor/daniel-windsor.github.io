            <h1>Approaching Problems</h1>
            <p>
              Sprint Four was a foray into problem solving. We were given a
              series of tests, and were told to write out a function that would
              allow those tests to pass. It started off simple - write a
              function that returns a number, or write a function that returns
              an array. Then it started getting a little complicated. Each
              function you wrote had to pass several different tests. You would
              write something that passed the first test, then you would adjust
              to meet the requirements of the second and so on.
            </p>
            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>
              This process went on and on, and it went well until one particular
              section: <strong>built in functions</strong>. JavaScript has a
              bunch of native classes. There's the String class, the Array
              class, the Number class and many <em>many</em> more. Each of these
              classes has a bunch of built in functions. For instance, the
              String class has a .split() function which will split the string
              into an array of strings based on whatever parameter you provide
              it. The challenge we were given was the same as the others. Use
              built in functions to create methods that pass the tests provided.
            </p>
            <p>Simple, right?</p>
            <p>Not for me, as it turns out.</p>
            <p>
              The great thing about writing your own functions is that you can
              decide what information your function needs, and exactly what it
              should do with that information. With built in functions, you
              don't get to decide. It has been decided for you. Fortunately,
              there is <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">documentation</a>
              which describes what the function needs and what it does with that
              information. Unfortunately, reading those docs is a skill in
              itself.
            </p>
            <p>One method in particular (array.map()) gave me a lot of trouble.
              .map() requires a function as an argument. I didn't know this, nor
              did I realise this while reading the docs.
            </p>
            <h3>Tackling the problem</h3>
            <p>I tried a variety of different problem solving methods to tackle
              this issue:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>First I tried pseudocode. I wrote in plain english what I was
                trying to achieve. This cleared up the steps, but didn't help
                with exactly how to write each step</li>
              <li>I tried a bunch of things. Had a guess and saw what happened.
                I used console.log a lot to check what information was being
                sent and received</li>
              <li>I googled a whole lot. I found some really good starting
                points here, which ultimately lead to figuring out the solution
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It took a long time to figure that one out, and it got a little
              frustration. But at least I was able to come to a solution using
              these techniques. Eventually.
            </p>
            <h3>The opposite</h3>
            <p>Sometimes (if you're lucky) when presented with a problem you
              have a moment of pure clarity. Everything makes sense. The
              mysteries of Life are open to you. Maybe that's a bit much. You
              know what I mean though.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was fortunate enough to have this moment (or something like it)
              during the FizzBuzz challenge. The idea of the challenge is you
              take an array of numbers. If the number is a multiple of three,
              replace the number with 'Fizz'. If the number is a multiple of 5,
              replace it with the word 'Buzz'. If the number is a multiple of
              15,
              replace it with the word 'FizzBuzz'. It makes total sense.
            </p>
            <p>From the beginning I felt I had a pretty good idea of how to
              solve this problem. I started by writing some psuedocode which
              basically said
              <code>
                Iterate through the array, checking each number against a
                condition. If the condition is met, replace the number with x
              </code>
              and went from there. My brilliant idea was to divide the array
              number by 3, 5 and 15. If it returned a whole number, replace it
              with the appropriate FizzBuzz. Genius right? Except there's an
              issue. If the number is nine, well that's divisible by three so
              replace the number nine with fizz. But what if the number is 15?
              That number is divisible by 3 and 5 and 15! How will the program
              know which word to use?
            </p>
            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <p>Do it backwards.</p>
            <p>
              That's really it. When you run through an if
              statement, the first statement that returns true causes the
              statement to exit, meaning the array number won't be checked
              against the other conditions. 15 will not be checked to see if
              it's divisible by 5 or 3. Only 15. I was pretty happy when that
              one worked.
            </p>
            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <p>
              There are a bunch of different techniques you could use when
              facing a problem
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pseudocode</li>
              <li>Trying something</li>
              <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
              <li>Reading error messages</li>
              <li>Console.loggin</li>
              <li>Googling</li>
              <li>Asking people for help</li>
              <li>Reflecting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Not every technique will work for each situation, but having a
              repertoire certainly comes in handy. After this sprint I
              definitely feel more confident in using these tools.
