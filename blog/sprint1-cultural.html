  <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values
      involved in that decision. the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
    <p>The most recent important decision I had to make was in deciding to take this course. Two months ago I had a
      stable job, a partner, and a baby. Today, I still have the partner and baby, but had to leave the job the start
      this course. The dilemma was this: Do I stay at this job that enables me to support my family but does not give me
      a sense of fulfillment, or do I leave the job for an exciting challenge but risk the financial stability? I have a
      responsibility to my family. They rely on me to support them and provide for them. It is extremely important to me
      that I meet this responsibility. I won't allow myself to let them down. At the same time, I value my own personal
      development. It's important for me to learn and grow and change. I value the mental challenge, the excitement of
      trying something new.</p>
    <p>
      It was hard for me to weigh up these values. Thankfully my family was very supportive through this process, and we
      had many discussions over the benefits of each choice. Without that support it would have been especially
      difficult to come to the decision I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the consequences of my choice, it still remains to be seen. I certainly feel happier and more mentally
      engaged in this new endeavour. That's a big plus. Long term though, I am hopeful that my family will benefit from
      my choices.</p>

    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
    <p>My brother and I were raised by our Mum since we were little. She did everything herself. She worked hard to
      provide for us. She never let us go without and was always willing to support us in our interest, even when the
      money wasn't always there. Being raised in this family culture has done a lot to shape who I am as a person today.
      <p>
        She taught me integrity, how it is important to have a moral or ethical code, and to stick to it even when it
        gets really difficult. She taught me to have accountability, to be responsible for your choices and actions. She
        taught me to persevere, that things don't come easy and you really have to work for what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        I give my Mum a lot of credit for instilling the values I have today.

    <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
    <p>
      A particular strength of mine is problem solving. Probably because I enjoy it so much. I love a good challenge. I
      love the chance to test myself against something new, to hopefully beat it and learn something new in the process.
      This is why I've chosen to learn development. Development is constant problem solving, whether it be creating
      something to solve a problem, or the hundreds of problems that appear in the process of creating that something.
    </p>
    <p>One issue that has caused difficulty is my trouble at managing conflict. In my previous role I was a team leader.
      It was my responsibility to make sure the team functioned well and no one was having any issues. Sometimes issues
      would appear between my staff and our clients. This would lead to the client being very unhappy, and as I was the
      team lead this unhappiness was often directed towards me. It would be my job to manage this conflict, to
      de-escalate and hopefully come to a solution. I found this to be difficult, and an awkward position to be in. I
      think one way to improve in this regard is to try and get ahead of the issue before it causes this kind of
      distress. Be aware of the warning signs and deal with the problem early on. This would make things a lot easier
      for everyone.
    </p>

    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with
      learning obstacles</h3>
    <p>Communication. IAs a teacher my job was to communicate concepts clearly. I think this skill will prove useful
      when working in a team. By being able to communicate with others and share our knowledge and understanding, it
      will make it easier to overcome challenges as a group. The idea that "You don't fully understand something until
      you are able to explain it in plain English to someone else" definitely applies here.

    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was
      resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections
      on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
    <p>A few years ago I was taking a course, a diploma in SCUBA diving instruction. Myself and my classmates were about
      half way through the year long programme, learning search and recovery techniques. This particular exercise
      required each of us to spread out in a line, equally spaced holding a rope between us. I was given the task of
      being the navigator. I was to swim in the right direction, while the other team members swim along side keeping
      the rope taught to ensure we stayed spaced apart. The idea was this way we would all swim in a straight line and
      can cover a lot of ground efficiently while searching for a small object.</p>
    <p>The set up went well.  We descended down to about five meters, all grabbed on to the rope and spread out.  I took a bearing on my compass and off we went.  It quickly fell apart.  We made it less than one meter before we were all crashing into each other.  This caused a particular group member to become very displeased with myself, because as the navigator I was leading the group.  We had a brief underwater argument before all surfacing.  There was some arguing and accusations from the whole group before we tried again, still with not much success.</p>
    <p>This whole situation was managed poorly at the time.  The arguing was not helpful, it only served to irritate further the already upset group member.  He felt like the rest of the team was ganging up on him.  This did not help to fix the situation, which is why we failed again on our second attempt.</p>
    <p>There is a lot I would change if faced with that same situation now.  Firstly, I would encourage the other group members not to get involved, and have more of a private conversation.  Try to de-escalate the situation so we can have a calm discussion.  I would listen to the person's complaints and work with them to find some solution to the problem that made everyone happy.  Good communication is really important in a team setting and it was not used here.</p>
